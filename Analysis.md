# Module 4 Analysis

In this challenge, data was provided for both students and schools within a district. Using tools and methods from the python Pandas library, the source data was joined to a single data frame, then sorted, binned, filtered, and aggregated to determine insights regarding school and student performance and spending. 

## Findings
The analysis of the data yeilded some key findings inlcuding the following:
### Reading Performance Exceeds Math Performance
When comparing both the average math and reading scores, as well as the percent of student above the passing level for each, reading tends to show better performacne than math. An interesting further analysis would be a comparison of these to established standards or other districts to see if math is consistently at a lower performance than reading regardless of location, or if this is a district-specific observation. 
### Charter Schools Are Outperforming District Schools
The top five schools for overall passing performance are charter schools, and the bottom five are all district schools. Charter schools average over a 90% pass rate compared to a measly 54% pass rate for district schools. A further step in the analysis would be to square this with spending for each school to determine if charters likley outperform districts because of specific methodologies or because they are better funded. 
### Issues Seem Concentrated in the Larger Schools
The passing rate for both small and medium sized schools far exceeds the average overall passing rate for the district, but the same cannot be said for the large schools. Improvements would likely be most effective if targetted toward this key group


This analysis of the data provides next steps and guidance for further research in the areas of funding impacts on charter performance, reading versus math trends for other districts, and large-school specific issues.
